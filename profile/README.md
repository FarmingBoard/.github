# Welcome to FarmingBoard üå±

FarmingBoard is an IoT-based system that serves smart farms by providing a comprehensive platform for monitoring, managing, and optimizing farm operations. Our solution is designed to improve the efficiency of farm management through real-time data, automation, and user-friendly interfaces.

## üåü Key Modules
FarmingBoard consists of the following key components:

1. **ThingsBoard Cloud**:  
   An IoT platform that allows for real-time monitoring and control of farm equipment, sensors, and environmental data. It serves as the backend for handling IoT devices and their data.

2. **Farm Owner Website**:  
   A web-based platform designed for farm owners to monitor the status of their farms, receive alerts, and manage their farm‚Äôs operations remotely.

3. **Mobile Application**:  
   A mobile app for farm owners to access their farm's data, control devices, and stay updated on farm activities from anywhere, at any time.

4. **Device Module**:  
   This module handles the integration and management of IoT devices such as sensors, cameras, and control units for farm automation. It ensures seamless communication between the devices and the ThingsBoard Cloud for real-time monitoring and control.
